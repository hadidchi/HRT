# HRT
This is the code used to perform power calculation for LME models in the paper that analyzed changes in body composition with respect to HRT status

Make sure that you have a csv with each row being a unique observation, an outcome column, a binary HRT column, and a column for participant id (idno). Additionally, every year of age past 60, 70, and 80 needs to be calculated for each person. Those below the age threshold should have 0.
